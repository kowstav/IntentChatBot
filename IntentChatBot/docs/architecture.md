### Infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- Nginx reverse proxy
- PostgreSQL database

## Data Flow
1. User sends message through frontend
2. Message is processed by NLP model
3. Intent is classified and confidence score calculated
4. Response is generated or escalated to human agent
5. All interactions are logged in PostgreSQL
