# backend/app/core/tasks.py
# This file is intended for background tasks, possibly using Celery or FastAPI's BackgroundTasks.

# Example of how you might structure a background task function
# (This is conceptual and not directly integrated with the rest of the app yet)

# from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

# async def send_email_notification(email_to: str, subject: str, body: str):
#     print(f"Simulating sending email to {email_to} with subject '{subject}'")
#     # Add actual email sending logic here
#     await asyncio.sleep(2) # Simulate I/O
#     print("Email sent (simulated).")

# How you might use it in an endpoint:
# @router.post("/some_action_that_needs_email")
# async def some_action(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, email: str):
#     # ... do some action ...
#     background_tasks.add_task(send_email_notification, email, "Action Completed", "Your action was successful.")
#     return {"message": "Action processed, notification will be sent."}
